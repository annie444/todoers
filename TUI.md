# TUI.md

Architecture outline for **`todoers`** — the ratatui terminal client. It holds
the keys and does all crypto (see [ENCRYPTION.md](./ENCRYPTION.md)), keeps a
local-first SQLite store, and talks to the blind relay over HTTP/WS (see
[API.md](./API.md)). This document covers the **UI architecture**: the event
loop, the `Component` trait, actions, modes, modals, and how networked work stays
off the render loop.

## Build note

The client uses **unchecked runtime `sqlx::query()`** against SQLite, so it
compiles with no database. It has a `vergen-gix` build script that reads
git/cargo/build info at compile time (used in `--version`), so a git repo must be
present to build. Run it with `cargo todoers` (alias for `run -p todoers --`).

## Entry point

`main.rs` builds a multi-thread Tokio runtime, then: init error/logging hooks →
parse `Cli` (`cli.rs`) → load `Config` (`config.rs`) → open the SQLite `Db`
(`db.rs`) → load any local `account` → construct `App` and call `App::run`.

## The Component architecture (`app.rs`)

`App` owns the whole client: a `Config`, the SQLite `Db`, the cached `account`
and unlocked `acct_keys`, the current `Mode`, a `HashMap<Mode, Box<dyn
Component>>`, an optional `Modal` overlay, persistent chrome (`Keys` footer,
`ErrorBar`), and an mpsc `Action` channel.

The main loop in `App::run` is:

```
handle_events  →  handle_actions  →  render
```

1. **`handle_events`** pulls the next `Event` from the `Tui` and turns it into
   `Action`s on the channel. It also routes the raw event to either the open
   modal *or* the active mode component (never both), so the background stays
   inert behind an overlay.
2. **`handle_actions`** drains the channel: `App` mutates global state for each
   action, then forwards the action to the modal or active component's `update`.
3. **`render`** draws the active mode in the body, then the modal on top, then the
   error bar and keybinding footer.

### The `Component` trait (`components/mod.rs`)

Every screen and widget implements `Component`. Only `draw` is required; the rest
default to no-ops:

- `register_action_handler(tx)` / `register_config_handler(config)` — wire the
  component to the action channel and live config.
- `init(area)` — one-time setup.
- `handle_events` → `handle_key_event` / `handle_mouse_event` — turn input into an
  optional `Action`.
- `update(action)` — react to an action, optionally emitting a follow-up.
- `draw(frame, area)` — render (required).
- `placement()` — layout constraint (defaults to fill).

The companion `Captures` trait says whether a component is currently swallowing
text input (see [Input capture](#input-capture)).

## Actions (`action.rs`)

`Action` is the single message enum — the only way state changes propagate.
Notable members: lifecycle (`Tick`, `Render`, `Resize`, `Suspend`, `Quit`,
`ClearScreen`), navigation (`SetMode`, `AuthChooser`, `*Modal`, `CloseModal`),
input/focus (`StartCapture`, `StopCapture`, `SubmitInput`, `SubmitForm`,
`FocusButtons`), and auth (`Register`, `Login`, `Unlock`, `Keys`).

> **Secrets in actions:** `Action::Register`, `Login`, and `Unlock` carry the
> password (`Zeroizing<String>`). They are deliberately redacted in `Display` and
> excluded from the `debug!` in `handle_actions` — **never log them verbatim.**
> `Keys` carries the unlocked secret keys; treat it the same way.

## Modes (`app.rs`)

`Mode` (`Home`, `Register`, `Login`) selects the active component and which
keybinding map is live. `Mode` implements `Captures` so the app knows, per mode,
whether typed keys should be swallowed by a focused form. Switching modes
(`handle_switch_mode`) rebuilds the keybinding footer and re-inits the component.

## Modals (`components/modal.rs`)

A `Modal` is a centered overlay that floats over whatever mode is running. It is
**mode-agnostic** — not in the `modes` map; `App` owns it as `Option<Modal>`,
routes events to it while open, and draws it last (it `Clear`s its own region).
It's a title + an arbitrary `body` component + a row of `Button`s; focus cycles
between buttons, and an interactive body (a form) can hold focus first.
Constructors: `Modal::new` (explicit buttons + `esc_action`), `Modal::message`
(single Close), `Modal::form` (Submit/Cancel around a form body).

The auth gate is driven entirely by modals: on `Tick`, if there is no verified
account, `App` emits `AuthChooser` → the user picks `LoginModal` or
`RegisterModal` → the form modal collects credentials and emits `Login` /
`Register`.

## Input capture

While a text field is focused, `App.capturing` is set. In `handle_key_event`,
captured keystrokes bypass keybinding dispatch so they reach the input — **except**
"global chords" (`is_global_chord`: any Ctrl/Alt combo), which always dispatch so
the user can quit/suspend/switch forms from inside a field or modal. A bare key
(`?`, letters, `Esc`, `Tab`, `Enter`) is left for the focused form/modal.

## Networked work runs off the UI loop

`App` never blocks the render loop on I/O. Registration, login, and unlock
`tokio::spawn` a task that calls into `net.rs` and feeds results back as
`Action`s (`Error`, or `Keys` + `StopCapture` + `CloseModal` + `SetMode`).
CPU-bound Argon2id KDF work is wrapped in `spawn_blocking`. Key separation:

- **`net.rs`** — HTTP transport only (reqwest); the two-message OPAQUE
  register/login flows and the offline fallback path.
- **`auth.rs`** — pure (builds/consumes wire DTOs, no I/O), so it stays
  unit-testable without a network.

`net::login` recovers keys from the server escrow on success and, when that fails
and a local `account` exists, falls back to an offline unlock. On first login on a
device it persists a local account so future launches recognize the user and
offline unlock works.

## Config (`config.rs`)

Defaults are baked in via `include_str!("../app_config.toml")`, then layered over
user files (toml/json/yaml/ini) from the XDG config dir. Keybindings and styles
parse from strings (e.g. `"ctrl-d"`, `"underline red on blue"`). The `Keys`
footer component renders the active mode's bindings (it's empty until
`register_config_handler` supplies the config — `refresh_keys` rebuilds it on
every mode switch).

## Components inventory (`components/`)

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Home` | Landing mode. |
| `Register` / `Login` / `Unlock` | Auth form bodies (live inside form modals). |
| `Modal` | Centered overlay host (title + body + buttons). |
| `Prompt` | Static message body (e.g. the auth chooser). |
| `Help` | Per-mode keybinding cheatsheet (message modal). |
| `Button` | Focusable button that emits an `Action` when activated. |
| `TextInput` | Single text field; drives `capturing`. |
| `Keys` | Persistent keybinding footer. |
| `ErrorBar` | Transient timed error banner. |

## Local store (`db.rs`)

SQLite, local-first: the materialized CRDT, an outbound queue for offline edits,
sync cursors against the server log, cached wrapped keys, the `account` row, and a
member directory for offline signature verification. See the at-rest class rules
in `todoers/db/migrations/0001_init.sql` and [ENCRYPTION.md](./ENCRYPTION.md).
